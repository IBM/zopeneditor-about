Currently, you can activate a permanent license key in two ways:</p><ol><li>Automatic activation using an RSE API server.</li><li>Manual activation by importing an activation kit.</li></ol><p>The IBM Z Open Editor Welcome page is used to report on the status of the trial license, the status of the automatic activation, as well as provides the means to import a manual activation kit. If the Welcome page does not open automatically at startup or you have already closed it, you can open it by entering <code>cmd/ctrl-shift-p</code> and typing or selecting <code>IBM Z Open Editor: Welcome</code>.</p><h2 id="automatic-activation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automatic-activation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Automatic activation</h2><p>Automatic activation uses the same technology that development clients for IBM Developer for z/OS Enterprise Edition use. It is ideal for organizations who run IBM Remote Systems Explorer (RSE) and allow their developers to choose between an Eclipse and VS Code development client. A system programmer provisioning RSE will install activation tokens that the editors retrieve automatically when they connect to RSE.</p><p>You can find more detailed instruction in the documentation for system programmers, such as in IBM Shopz. The general steps are:</p><ol><li>Install and complete basic configuration of z/OS host component IBM z/OS Explorer Extensions, FMID HHOPxxx.</li><li>Install and complete basic configuration of z/OS host component IBM Remote System Explorer API (RSE API), FMID HAMAxxx.</li></ol><p>The Z Open Editor end users can then use the VS Code user setting <code>zopeneditor.advancedCapabilities.enableRseApiActivationCheck</code> to enable the automatic RSE check. The Z Open Editor Welcome page also provides a convenient check box to enable these settings.</p><p>Once enabled, the next time you connect to the RSE API server via Zowe Explorer or Z Open Editor, an automatic check for activation will be executed. If successful, the Z Open Editor Welcome page will report the activation status in a table.</p><p>Notes:</p>',11),p=t("li",null,"Host component IBM Explorer for z/OS, FMID HALGxxx, is a prerequisite for both IBM z/OS Explorer Extensions and IBM Remote System Explorer API (RSE API).",-1),u=e("You can use the Host Configuration Assistant at "),m={href:"https://zdev-hca.ibm.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v=e("https://zdev-hca.ibm.com"),b=e(" to guide you through the required host configuration."),g=t("li",null,"The provided activation tokens operate for a limited time.
