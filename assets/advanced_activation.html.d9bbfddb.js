Currently, you can activate a permanent license key in two ways:</p><ol><li>Automatic activation using an RSE API server.</li><li>Manual activation by importing an activation kit.</li></ol><p>The IBM Z Open Editor Welcome page is used to report on the status of the trial license, the status of the automatic activation, as well as provides the means to import a manual activation kit. If the Welcome page does not open automatically at startup or you have already closed it, you can open it by entering <code>cmd/ctrl-shift-p</code> and typing or selecting <code>IBM Z Open Editor: Welcome</code>.</p><p>In the &quot;Advanced capabilities&quot; section of the Welcome page, you find two expandable sections:</p><ul><li>Available Features: Displays the advanced features currently enabled. A checkmark icon indicates that the feature is active. A lock icon means the trial period has expired for that feature or the imported license does not cover it.</li><li>Activation Status: Shows the license activation currently in use. If you are using a trial license, it displays the expiration date.

This method is ideal for organizations that run IBM Remote Systems Explorer (RSE) and enable their developers to choose between Eclipse and VS Code as their development clients.
