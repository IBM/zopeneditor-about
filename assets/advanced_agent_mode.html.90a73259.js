Refer to the Z Open Editor page for a list of available tools, you can combine them with tools from other MCP servers and with the built\u2011in tools. Here are few things you can try. Note, the responses you receive depend on the language model you use and on other factors.</p><p>Try some of the following examples, if a valid Zowe profile is configured in your workspace that can be used to access z/OS data sets, files, and jobs through Zowe Explorer. Replace the example names with your own.</p><ul><li><p>&quot;<em>List the members of the data set USER.SAMPLE.COBOL that start with the prefix SAM</em>&quot;. The AI prompts you for permission to execute the MCP tool &quot;zowe-get-members&quot; with the data set name you provided. After you approve the execution, the tool returns the list of members that start with SAM. Expand and examine the tool entry in the chat to see the full response. You see that the AI reduced the full list of members it received to the members that match the prefix.</p></li><li><p>Open a modified version of one of the programs listed in the previous step and ask &quot;<em>Download the member with the name SAM1 and compare to the currently open COBOL program in my editor.</em>&quot; The chat asks for approval to execute the &quot;zowe-download-member&quot; tool. After approval, the tool fetches the member and the AI provides a detailed explanation of the differences. The more the large language mode is trained on COBOL, the richer the explanation. If your are looking for a sample program, use the files &quot;COBOL/SAM1.cbl&quot; and &quot;multiroot/sam/SAM1.cbl&quot; from our <a href="./samplefiles">samples repository</a>. They are different versions of the same application.</p></li><li><p>&quot;<em>What are the jobs of user IBMUSER grouped by status?</em>&quot; The AI returns a list of job names organized in sections by status.</p></li><li><p>Use Zowe Explorer to open a JCL file from one of your data sets in Z Open Editor and ask &quot;<em>Submit the JCL in the currently open editor as a job.</em>&quot; It will prompt for approval of the &quot;zowe-submit-job-dataset&quot; tool with the correct data set name. If you would have opened a local file it would have used the tool &quot;zowe-submit-job-jcl&quot; instead. After it ran the command it will show you the job id, name, and status of your job. It might even ask you to retrieve the job output or current status.</p></li><li><p>Do retrieve the outputs from your job by replying &quot;<em>Yes, retrieve the spool files for me.</em>&quot; which will result into the list of files available, asking you which one you want to see. Reply with &quot;<em>Show me SYSOUT</em>&quot;, which it then retrieves and displays in the chat. If the output contained error messages, then some AI models will even explain the reasons for why things might have gone wrong. If you ask &quot;<em>Fetch SYSOUT and open it in a VS Code editor tab</em>&quot;, it would do that as well after asking you for permission, if it is allowed to save the content in a workspace file first.</p></li><li><p>&quot;<em>Fetch my .profile file from my UNIX home directory and open it in the editor. My userid is ibmuser.</em>&quot;. The AI deduces the home directory &quot;/u/ibmuser&quot;, asks for approval, downloads the file, and opens it in VS\u202FCode. If the deduction is incorrect, reject the request and refine the prompt with more specifics.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to Zowe interactions, you can use tools and resources provided by Z Open Editor&#39;s MCP server to query your configuration.</p><ul><li><p>&quot;<em>List my Zowe profiles and the profiles defined as default for Z Open Editor.</em>&quot;. The AI executes two MCP tools, &quot;zowe-list-all-profiles&quot; and &quot;zopeneditor-get-default-zowe-profile&quot;, then lists all profiles found in your personal Zowe team configuration files together with the default profile used by Z\u202FOpen\u202FEditor.</p></li><li><p>&quot;<em>What are my ZAPP property groups for this workspace for COBOL and HLASM?</em>&quot;. AI calls &quot;zapp-get-property-groups&quot; twice and returns a summary for each language, assuming the property groups are defined in your ZAPP file.</p></li><li><p>Open a program where some copybooks cannot be found and ask: &quot;<em>Using the zopeneditor.log resource and the ZAPP property groups, analyze why copybook include files could not be found for the currently open program?</em>&quot; Depending on the language model, the AI automatically uses the MCP resource defined by Z Open Editor MCP or prompts you to execute the tool &quot;zopeneditor-read-the-log&quot; together with he previously retrieved ZAPP information, then provides a detailed breakdown of the search process, listing locations that succeeded, locations that failed, and user settings that may have influenced the search.</p></li><li><p>To use the Z Open Editor log file as a resource in GitHub Chat, click the &quot;Add Context...&quot; button in the chat panel, select the file under &quot;MCP Resources&quot; in the prompt at the top of the screen and confirm. The log file then appears next to the open program as context for your questions. You can use it to find various types of information from a DEBUG-level log file, such as details about your Zowe configuration, the version of Java used by the editor, user setting values, and more.</p></li></ul><p>You can combine Z\u202FOpen\u202FEditor\u2019s capabilities with the VS\u202FCode built\u2011in MCP tools listed earlier.</p><ul><li><p>Open a COBOL program and run an IBM ZCodeScan through the right-click menu. If the scan finds issues they will be listed in the VS Code Problems view panel and can be utilized by the Chat. Ask &quot;<em>Can you explain the issues listed in the Problems view for COBOL developers and how to fix them?</em>&quot; If your large language model has been trained on COBOL, it will give you a detailed description of the problems found and make suggestions for how to fix them.</p></li><li><p>&quot;<em>Who made the last few changes on this program looking at the Git history?</em>&quot;. The AI generates a command line that queries the local Git repository, retrieves recent commits, and displays their descriptions.</p></li><li><p>&quot;<em>Can you find other programs in the workspace that have the same ACCEPT-DATE and ACCEPT-TIME statements that need fixing?</em>&quot;. The AI uses the context of the previous interactions, runs a VS Code Search to find similar statements in other files in your workspace and lists the matching files with line numbers.</p></li></ul><p>As these examples demonstrate, a basic set of MCP tools can be used and combined in many ways, providing endless opportunities to make your development activities more productive. You no longer have to learn the syntax of complex Zowe CLI commands, search manually through large log files, or download, save, and compare files versions. Just ask the AI to do this for you. With many more tools on the horizon, IDz on VS Code seamlessly integrates into your AI workflows and use cases, delivering new capabilities as more tools become available.</p><h2 id="setup-using-roo-code" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setup-using-roo-code" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Setup using Roo Code</h2>',10),ne={href:"https://roocode.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ae=t("Roo Code"),ie=t(" is gaining popularity as an alternative to GitHub Copilot Chat.
