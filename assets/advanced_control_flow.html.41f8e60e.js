These buttons allow zooming in and out of the graph, and a reset button on the far right sets the zoom level to 100%, returning the graph to its default scale.</p><p>A caret icon to the left of the zoom controls toggles the visibility of the minimap, which starts collapsed by default. When expanded, the minimap displays a scaled-down overview of the entire graph, and clicking within it repositions the main graph view to the selected location.</p><h2 id="actions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#actions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Actions</h2><p>Each node in the Program Control Flow Browser represents a different program element, depending on the language:</p><ul><li><strong>COBOL programs</strong>: Nodes represent paragraphs, sections, or the procedure division</li><li><strong>PL/I programs</strong>: Nodes represent procedures, package, or the program setup</li></ul><p>Clicking a node highlights the corresponding element in the source code and opens a details panel showing the full name of the element (or the program name, if the <strong>Program</strong> node is selected), along with its start and end line numbers in the program.</p><p>When a node is clicked, the graph automatically focuses on control flow paths that might transfer control to or from the selected node, while unrelated nodes become slightly transparent.</p><p>The following actions are available through the overflow menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right of each node:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Show Program Control From Here</strong>: Displays a graph showing all control flow paths that originate from the selected node. This helps visualize how control progresses through the program from that point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show Program Control To Here</strong>: Displays a graph showing all control flow paths that lead to the selected node. This helps identify potential entry points or calling paths that reach the selected code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show Program Control From Here To...</strong>: First, the user is prompted to select a node reachable through control flow from the current node. After selecting an end node, this action displays a graph showing all control flow paths from the start node to the selected node. This helps in understanding the scope and control flow between different parts of a program.</p></li></ul><p>A <strong>Reload</strong> button is available in the top-right corner of the browser. Clicking this button regenerates the graph for the currently opened COBOL or PL/I program, incorporating any recent edits to the source code. For files that contain multiple top-level programs, the <strong>Reload</strong> button regenerates the graph based on the program at the current cursor position. If a previous actions was applied, using <strong>Reload</strong> resets the graph to its default state and displays all nodes.</p><h3 id="search" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#search" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Search</h3><p>The Program Control Flow Browser provides search capabilities to help locate specific nodes in large graphs.</p><p>Click the magnifying glass icon to expand the search input field. A search starts automatically as you enter text. After it completes, a match counter becomes visible that displays the current match index out of the total results. Press Enter/Shift+Enter or use the arrow controls to cycle through matching nodes. To clear the search, click the \u201C\xD7\u201D icon on the right side of the input field.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="&#39;control-flow-search&#39;"></p><p>You can search for nodes using regular expressions by enabling the <strong>Use Regular Expression</strong> toggle. This toggle appears after you expand the search input field and is enabled by clicking on it. When the toggle is enabled, the search input is interpreted as a regular expression pattern. Patterns must follow JavaScript regex syntax, including proper character escaping. Enter the pattern without enclosing it in forward slashes. Matching is case-insensitive, and other regular expression flags are not supported. An error message appears below the search bar for invalid regular expressions.</p><h3 id="export" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#export" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Export</h3><p>The Program Control Flow Browser includes an export feature that enables you to save the current graph in various formats. The export action is located in the top-right of the toolbar, to the left of the search bar.</p><p>To export a graph:</p><ol><li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button in the toolbar</li><li>Select one of the available export formats from the dropdown: JSON, PDF, SVG, PNG, XML, or DOT (for GraphViz)</li><li>Enter a name for the exported file in the input field</li><li>Click <strong>Export</strong></li><li>When the export is ready, a file dialog appears where you can choose the save location</li></ol><p>The export always includes the full graph as currently displayed. To export a specific section of the Program Control Flow graph, use one of the &quot;Show Program Control&quot; actions (such as <strong>Show Program Control From Here</strong> or <strong>Show Program Control To Here</strong>) to limit the graph&#39;s scope before exporting. If you have selected a node, nodes that do not share flow with the selected node become slightly transparent, the those transparent styles are preserved in the exported output. The colors in the exported file match your current VS Code theme (light or dark).</p><p>For large graphs, visual exports (PDF, SVG, PNG) can take a significant amount of time to generate.</p><h3 id="settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Settings</h3><p>The Program Control Flow Browser includes a settings menu for customization.
