These buttons allow zooming in and out of the graph, and a reset button on the far right sets the zoom level to 100%, returning the graph to its default scale.</p><p>A caret icon to the left of the zoom controls toggles the visibility of the minimap, which starts collapsed by default. When expanded, the minimap displays a scaled-down overview of the entire graph, and clicking within it repositions the main graph view to the selected location.</p><h2 id="actions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#actions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Actions</h2><p>Each node in the Program Control Flow Browser represents a different program element, depending on the language:</p><ul><li><strong>COBOL programs</strong>: Nodes represent paragraphs, sections, or the procedure division</li><li><strong>PL/I programs</strong>: Nodes represent procedures, package, or the program setup</li></ul><p>Clicking a node highlights the corresponding element in the source code and opens a details panel showing the full name of the element (or the program name, if the <strong>Program</strong> node is selected), along with its start and end line numbers in the program.</p><p>When a node is clicked, the graph automatically focuses on control flow paths that might transfer control to or from the selected node, while unrelated nodes become slightly transparent.</p><p>The following actions are available through the overflow menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right of each node:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Show Program Control Flow From Here</strong>: Displays a graph showing all control flow paths that originate from the selected node. This helps visualize how control progresses through the program from that point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show Program Control Flow To Here</strong>: Displays a graph showing all control flow paths that lead to the selected node. This helps identify potential entry points or calling paths that reach the selected code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Show Program Control Flow From Here To...</strong>: First, the user is prompted to select a node reachable through control flow from the current node. After selecting an end node, this action displays a graph showing all control flow paths from the start node to the selected node. This helps in understanding the scope and control flow between different parts of a program.</p></li></ul><p>A <strong>Reload</strong> button is available in the top-right corner of the browser.

This toggle appears after you expand the search input field and is enabled by clicking on it. When the toggle is enabled, the search input is interpreted as a regular expression pattern.
