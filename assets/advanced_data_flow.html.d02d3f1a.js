You can use these buttons to zoom in and out, and a reset button on the far right sets the zoom level to 100%, returning the graph to its default scale.</p><p>A caret icon to the left of the zoom controls toggles the visibility of the minimap, which is collapsed by default. When expanded, the minimap displays a scaled-down overview of the entire graph. Clicking within the minimap repositions the main graph view to the selected location.</p><h2 id="understanding-data-flow-graphs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-data-flow-graphs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Understanding Data Flow Graphs</h2><p>The graph in the Data Flow Browser consists of nodes and edges. Each node represents a data element, file, or literal that is connected in some way to the data element selected for the data flow. Each node includes a label and a type. Types are indicated by distinct icons and displayed in bold text, while labels correspond to the name of the element represented by the node.</p><p>The graph includes the following node types:</p><ul><li><strong>Data</strong>: Regular data items and variables</li><li><strong>File</strong>: File descriptors and file-related elements</li><li><strong>Structure</strong>: Group items and record structures</li><li><strong>Entry point</strong>: Alternate entry points where data flow begins</li><li><strong>Data store</strong>: Data storage elements</li><li><strong>Literal</strong>: Literal values and constants</li></ul><p>There are two styles of edges: solid and dashed.</p><ul><li><strong>Solid</strong>: Solid edges represent the statement or statements that cause data to flow to or from the target element. When data flows to the target element, the edge&#39;s arrow points toward it. When data flows from the target element, the arrow points away.</li><li><strong>Dashed</strong>: When an element is a group element, data flowing to or from that element also affects the values of its members. Likewise, when an element is a member of a group, data flowing to or from that element also affects the value of the group. This hierarchical relationship between a group and its members is represented by a dashed edge.</li></ul><p>Hovering over either type of edge displays a tooltip with relevant information. The tooltip a solid edge contains the line number and statement responsible for data flow between the two nodes. The tooltip for a dashed edge contains the relevant data definition.</p><h2 id="actions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#actions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Actions</h2><p>Clicking a node in the Data Flow Browser highlights the corresponding element in the source code and opens a details panel showing the full name of the data element, its start and end line numbers, and the file in which it was declared. When a node is clicked, the graph automatically focuses on data flow paths that can transfer data to or from the selected node, while unrelated nodes become slightly transparent.</p><p>For <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Structure</strong> nodes, a <strong>Show Data Flow for this Node</strong> action is available through the overflow menu (three vertical dots) in the upper-right of the node. Selecting this action displays the data flow for the node.</p><h3 id="search" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#search" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Search</h3><p>The Data Flow Browser provides search capabilities to help locate specific nodes in large graphs.</p><p>Click the magnifying glass icon to expand the search input field. A search starts automatically as you enter text. After it completes, a match counter becomes visible that displays the current match index out of the total results. Press Enter/Shift+Enter or use the arrow controls to cycle through matching nodes. To clear the search, click the \u201C\xD7\u201D icon on the right side of the input field.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="&#39;data-flow-search&#39;"></p><p>You can search for nodes using regular expressions by enabling the <strong>Use Regular Expression</strong> toggle. This toggle appears after you expand the search input field and is enabled by clicking on it. When the toggle is enabled, the search input is interpreted as a regular expression pattern. Patterns must follow JavaScript regex syntax, including proper character escaping. Enter the pattern without enclosing it in forward slashes. Matching is case-insensitive, and other regular expression flags are not supported. An error message appears below the search bar for invalid regular expressions.</p><h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Limitations</h2><ul><li>Data flow analysis supports COBOL programs only; PL/I is not supported</li><li>It supports base COBOL language elements and some embedded languages, such as CICS and SQL; however, DLI is not supported</li><li>Large programs with extensive data flow may take longer to generate and display</li></ul>',21);function I(z,A){const o=n("RouterLink"),s=n("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),l(h,null,[f,e("p",null,[m,a(o,{to:"/Docs/advanced_activation.html"},{default:r(()=>[w]),_:1}),b]),_,y,e("p",null,[v,a(o,{to:"/Docs/setting_propertygroup.html"},{default:r(()=>[x]),_:1}),D,e("a",k,[F,a(s)]),T]),B,S,e("p",null,[L,a(o,{to:"/Docs/advanced_resource_table.html"},{default:r(()=>[C]),_:1}),E]),O],64)}var V=c(u,[["render",I]]);export{V as default};
