The preprocessor would be executed on either a developer machine by Z Open Editor in the background (local) or a z/OS system (remote), taking COBOL with custom code and transforming it to valid COBOL. Users can then edit such programs by using the preprocessor output to still provide full language support such as code completion, syntax error highlighting, and outline view. The editor would not learn the preprocessor language, but rather ensure that the resulting preprocessed output is still valid COBOL.</p><h2 id="local-preprocessor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#local-preprocessor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Local preprocessor</h2><h3 id="example-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-workflow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example workflow</h3><p>The following workflow is written from the perspective of COBOL developer, Deb.</p><ol><li>Deb installs a command-line centric preprocessor program on her local development machine.</li><li>Deb creates a <code>zapp.yaml</code> file with a preprocessor profile type.
