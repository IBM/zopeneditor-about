After the files and settings are in place, a program opens in the editor, and its dependencies such as copybooks are found as specified in the ZAPP file. A build starts when you right-click inside the editor and select one of the available commands from the context menu:</p><ul><li><strong>Run IBM User Build with full upload</strong>: which is the required command to run at the first execution of a user build for a particular program. This command uploads all include files for the program, the program itself and all files listed under <code>additionalDependencies</code> in the ZAPP file before running the build command specified in the ZAPP file.</li><li><strong>Run IBM User Build</strong>: is the command you can run at subsequent executions of the build that provides a faster execution, because it only uploads an include file if it was changed since the last time you ran a user build and it will not upload <code>additionalDependencies</code> anymore. It just uploads the program file and build it. If you require upload of the other files again, choose the first option.</li></ul><p>By default, user build commands are only available for COBOL, HLASM, and PL/I files. To show user build commands in context menus and the command palette for all files (excluding include files and copybooks), you can set the <code>zopeneditor.userbuild.alwaysShowCommands</code> setting to <code>true</code>. This enables users to a run user build with a custom Groovy and zBuilder script on files of other languages. This setting is experimental and may result in unexpected Z Open Editor behavior when running a user build on non-COBOL, HLASM, or PL/I programs.</p><h2 id="advanced-problems-view-integration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advanced-problems-view-integration" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Advanced problems view integration</h2><p>In version before Z Open Editor v4, when you run a build of a program directly from inside Z Open Editor through the context menu, the build completes by downloading the build log files into the local development workspace.
