Verify that dependencies such as copybooks are found as specified in the ZAPP file. When you finish editing the program, start a build by right-clicking inside the editor and select one of the available commands from the context menu:</p><ul><li><strong>Run IBM User Build with full upload</strong>: Required for the first execution of a user build for a particular program. This command uploads all include files for the program, the program itself, and all files listed under <code>additionalDependencies</code> in the ZAPP file before running the build command specified in the ZAPP file.</li><li><strong>Run IBM User Build</strong>: Used for subsequent executions of the build. This command provides faster execution because it uploads an include file only if it changed since the last user build. It does not upload <code>additionalDependencies</code>. It uploads the program file and builds it. If you require upload of the other files again, choose the first option.</li></ul><p>By default, user build commands are available only for COBOL, HLASM, and PL/I files. To show user build commands in context menus and the command palette for all files (excluding include files and copybooks), set the <code>zopeneditor.userbuild.alwaysShowCommands</code> setting to <code>true</code>. This enables running a user build with a custom Groovy and zBuilder script on files of other languages. This setting is experimental and can result in unexpected Z Open Editor behavior when running a user build on non-COBOL, HLASM, or PL/I programs.</p><p>The DBB build output also indicates the results of the build in the output console window.

See the information later in this section and verify whether you must update your ZAPP files to keep the feature working.</em></p><p>When you edit enterprise application code in Z\xAE Open Editor, language servers provide code completion and real-time syntax error detection. However, the language servers in Z Open Editor can only identify problems that a parser detects, such as basic syntax errors. A compiler goes through many more stages after parsing, generating additional information and warning messages for problems that a parser cannot detect. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to build the program and review the compiler output to ensure that the program is correct, limited of course to what the compiler can detect without actually running tests.</p><p>When you run a build of a program directly from inside Z Open Editor through the context menu, the build completes by downloading the build log files into the local development workspace. Prior to Z Open Editor v4, you had to manually review the entire log file by opening it in the editor and scrolling through it.</p><p>If you unlock Z Open Editor&#39;s advanced capabilities and enable the feature through a setting in the ZAPP file, Dependency Based Build log files are parsed by Z Open Editor and presented as errors and warnings in the regular VS Code Problems view. You can click entries in the Problems view to navigate directly to the line in the code where the problem is reported. These errors appear side by side with regular Z Open Editor errors, but you can distinguish them by the compiler error number displayed next to them.</p><p>The Problems view can be cleared manually through by right-clicking any message or automatically when you rerun a build.</p><p><img src="`+u+`" alt="User Build Problems View"></p><p>The preceding screenshot shows an example of the Problems view that reports a warning about a <code>RECORD IS VARYING</code> statement not matching the required range. This problem can only be detected when the program is built. Combining parser errors with user build errors and warnings provides developers with new ways to identify problems that were previously undetectable.</p><p>To enable this feature, you must edit your ZAPP file to add an additional command parameter: <code>--errPrefix \${errPrefix}</code></p><p>For zBuilder, add another line to the <code>lifecycleArgs</code> like this</p><div class="language-yaml ext-yml line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-yaml"><code><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token key atrule">name</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> zBuilder<span class="token punctuation">-</span>userbuild
