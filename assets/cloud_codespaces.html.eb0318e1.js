Developers can install additional software and update components. You can even make devcontainer configuration changes on the fly and let VS Code recreate the container with the new components and settings from within VS Code. OpenShift Dev Spaces workspaces run in Kubernetes as immutable containers that cannot be modified by the developer. For installing additional or updated software, Dev Spaces requires building and publishing a new image from a dockerfile. The advantage is that these containers are more secure, because developers cannot randomly install software that was not reviewed and approved by your organization. This also ensures that all developers in a team work with the exact same versions and configuration settings avoiding the &quot;it runs in my container&quot; effect.</li><li><strong>Codespaces is only available at github.com</strong>: OpenShift Dev Spaces can be installed wherever OpenShift runs, which includes on-premises deployments using x86 as well as s390x Linux on Z platforms, deployments at all the major Cloud providers such as IBM Cloud, AWS, or Azure, and even your personal laptop or developer machine with OpenShift Local. GitHub Codespaces is only available on github.com. It is not available for GitHub Enterprise for on-premises deployments. However, you can use it from a private organization and you can configure it with access to your company network using OpenVPN technology as described below in <a href="#connecting-to-a-zos-system-using-a-vpn">Connecting to a z/OS system using a VPN</a>.</li><li><strong>Codespaces configuration files are portable to custom containers</strong>: The devfiles you create for OpenShift DevSpaces workspaces can only be used, at the moment, in an OpenShift Dev Spaces deployment. However, the Codespaces devcontainer files and dockerfiles can generally be used interchangeably between Codespaces and personal containers running locally on your developer machine or on on-premises virtual machines.</li></ul><h2 id="configuring-a-sample-z-open-editor-workspace" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configuring-a-sample-z-open-editor-workspace" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Configuring a sample Z Open Editor workspace</h2>',3),z=o("In our Z Open Editor Samples Git repository at "),O={href:"https://github.com/IBM/zopeneditor-sample",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},N=o("https://github.com/IBM/zopeneditor-sample"),P=o(' we provide a special branch called "devcontainer" that contains examples for Codespaces configuration files that you can try.
