Hosting development tools and editors in the Cloud can provide many advantages for developers as well as team leads and administrators, especially for hybrid z/OS development projects that bring together different technologies, require different skill sets and knowledge about development tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Eliminating the need for developers to install and configure all development tools locally</strong>: Instead of having every developer in a development organization install tools and prerequisites themselves on their own development machines one lead developer can produce one or many container images with all the prerequisites as well as configuration files that load the correct versions of tools and VS Code extensions that every developer can simply use to get a full development environment. This can save a lot of time, eliminate confusion about versions, ensures that everyone is on the same and latest versions as well as help developers that are not familiar with all the tools and prerequisites and how to correctly install and configure them.</li><li><strong>Rapid context switching between development project using different</strong>: When working on multiple development projects at the same time container-based development environments allow easy switching between completed different stacks of development tools, configuration and settings as well as even programming languages and language versions by just switching to different containers and configuration files manged by Cloud-based development tools providing workspace templates that can be customized for the very specific needs of each project.</li><li><strong>Eliminate hardware requirements and work from anywhere</strong>: As all tools are accessed via a simple web-browser there is no need for using a specific hardware or workstations to do development work. Organizations can deploy cheaper developer hardware and can centralize and optimize resource usage in their Cloud infrastructure instead. Switching between working from home or the office will be as easy as connecting to a network and then using the browser to sign on and open all tools.</li><li><strong>Standardize connectivity, integrations, and authentication to external systems and applications</strong>: Instead of connecting each developer machine to external systems such as z/OS systems, databases, or web servers via technologies such as VPNs making each of these system a potential security risk and target target for external attacks Cloud-based development environments bring control of connectivity and security back to the experts that maintain access for all developers in a central place. As developers will access all tools and systems via the integrated development environment in the browser that is prepared for them and authentication secrets are stored in secure Cloud storage as well, there is less risk of them misconfiguring secure access to sensitive systems.</li></ul><h2 id="quickstart-tutorials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quickstart-tutorials" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quickstart tutorials</h2><p>The following examples show you how your can get started very quickly with some of the most popular Cloud-based environments from different vendors to evaluate if such solutions work for you.
