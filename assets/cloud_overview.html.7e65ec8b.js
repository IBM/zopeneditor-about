Hosting development tools and editors in the Cloud can provide many advantages for developers as well as team leads and administrators, especially for hybrid z/OS\xAE development projects that bring together different technologies, require different skill sets and knowledge about development tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Eliminate the need for developers to install and configure all development tools locally</strong>: Instead of having every developer in a development organization install tools and prerequisites themselves on their own development machines, one lead developer can produce one or many container images with all the prerequisites as well as configuration files that load the correct versions of tools and VS Code extensions that every developer can simply use to get a full development environment. This can save a lot of time, eliminate confusion about versions, ensures that everyone is on the same and latest versions as well as help developers who are not familiar with all the tools and prerequisites and how to correctly install and configure them.</li><li><strong>Rapid context switching between development projects using different development tools</strong>: When you work on multiple development projects at the same time, container-based development environments enable easy switching between completely different stacks of development tools, configuration, settings and even programming languages and language versions. This is done by switching to different containers and configuration files managed by Cloud-based development tools that provides workspace templates, which can be customized for the very specific needs of each project.</li><li><strong>Eliminate hardware requirements and work from anywhere</strong>: As all tools are accessed through a simple web-browser, there is no need to use a specific hardware or workstations to do development work. Instead, organizations can deploy cost-effective developer hardware and can centralize and optimize resource usage in their Cloud infrastructure. Switching between working from home or the office is as easy as connecting to a network and then using the browser to sign on and open all tools.</li><li><strong>Standardize connectivity, integrations, and authentication to external systems and applications</strong>: Instead of connecting each developer machine to external systems such as z/OS systems, databases, or web servers through technologies such as VPNs, making each of these systems a potential security risk and target for external attacks. Cloud-based development environment brings control of connectivity and security back to the experts that maintain access for all developers in a central place. Developers access all tools and systems through the integrated development environment in the browser that is prepared for them and authentication secrets are stored in secure Cloud storage as well, there is lower risk of misconfiguring secure access to sensitive systems.</li></ul><h2 id="quickstart-tutorials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quickstart-tutorials" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quickstart tutorials</h2><p>The following examples show you how you can get started very quickly with some of the most popular Cloud-based environments from different vendors to evaluate if such solutions work for you.
