The editor applies a suggestion to the file based on the context of the cursor position. For a cursor position inside a stem, the suggestion replaces the entire symbol. For a cursor position inside the tail of a compound symbol, the suggestion replaces a segment of the symbol. The casing of the suggestion replaces the casing of the symbol in the file.

Keywords and built-in functions do not appear as references. The matches are determined by the context of the symbol. Internal routines match to their calls. Stems match to other stems. Simple symbols match to other simple symbols. Constant symbols match to other constant symbols. For compound symbols, the tail is broken into separate pieces, delimited by its periods, and matched to other constant or simple symbols.
