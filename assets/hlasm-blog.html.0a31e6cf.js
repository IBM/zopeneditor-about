While designing the outline view, we experimented with including every symbol within a program. However, after better learning our user&#39;s needs, we found that it is better to simply have only CSECTs, DSECTs, and macros in the outline view. Often, if every symbol were to be included, the outline view would become extremely cluttered. The outline view is not the only feature where we&#39;ve kept assembler&#39;s distinctiveness firmly in mind. In our code completion, we include reference information about assembler instructions. And, last but not least, we have included configurable vertical bars and tab stops to help users easily &#39;eyeball&#39; sequence numbers and continuation line indicators.
