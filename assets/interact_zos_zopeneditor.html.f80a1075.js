If the requested file exists, the editor will send another request to download it. If the requested file does not exist, the editor will move on to test the next location listed in the property group.</li><li>When the setting is set to <code>false</code>, the editor will directly try to download the file from MVS without checking whether it exists. If the response from z/OS is a Not Found error, the editor will move on to the next location listed in the property group. In some cases when using z/OSMF as the protocol, this <code>Not Found</code> error will cause entries in z/OS log files, which you can avoid by specifying the value of the setting to <code>true</code>.</li></ul><p>This extra round trip to the server when set to <code>true</code> to check the existence will have a performance impact. Because the logging is not always an issue for all z/OSMF users and not an issue when using the RSE API protocol, and because of the performance advantage, the default value for this setting is <code>false</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>maximumParallelFileDownloads</code>: The value can be used to specify how many parallel downloads Z Open Editor should perform when requesting include files from MVS. Downloading several files in parallel can significantly improve performance, especially when you edit programs with many include files. The downside is that some protocols such as z/OSMF will allocate more address spaces for the parallel requests, which causes more resources to be used and more logging on the z/OS side. The RSE API protocol does not have that problem because it achieves scalability in other ways that are outlined in the RSE documentation. The default value for this setting is 5, and the maximum value is 10. Set it to 1 to disable parallel downloads and request one include file at a time.</p></li>",2),k=t(`<h2 id="changing-the-zowe-profile-using-vs-code-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#changing-the-zowe-profile-using-vs-code-settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Changing the Zowe Profile using VS Code settings</h2><p>The format of the <code>zopeneditor.zowe</code> user setting is as follows:</p><div class="language-json ext-json line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-json"><code><span class="token property">&quot;zopeneditor.zowe&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
