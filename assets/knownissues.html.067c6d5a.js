The encoding of the dependency file generated during an IBM User Build was recently changed from <code>IBM-1047</code> to a standard <code>UTF-8</code> encoding. This change means that if the latest version of IBM Z Open Editor is not paired with DBB zAppBuild 2.3.0 or greater you will have to add the previously required <code>IBM-1047</code> encoding to the dependency file being generated, by adding the following to your <code>.gitattributes</code> file in your project in order to run an IBM User Build successfully:</p><p><code>*.userbuilddependencies zos-working-tree-encoding=ibm-1047 git-encoding=utf-8</code></p><h3 id="other-known-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-known-issues" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Other known issues</h3><ul><li>Currently you cannot upload and build programs that start with a <code>$</code> in their name.</li><li>The ZAPP code snippet for user build profiles misses a mandatory property.

Builds can work without it as well.</li><li>When local program files are managed as lowercase files a <code>logFilePatterns</code> with the expression <code>&quot;${buildFile.basename}.log&quot;</code> will not work as dbb-zappbuild will generate the log file with an uppercase name.</li></ul><h2 id="reporting-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reporting-issues" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reporting issues</h2>',6),je=o("If you want to provide feedback or report an issue, open an issue in the "),Ge={href:"https://github.com/IBM/zopeneditor-about/issues",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Je=o("GitHub repository"),Ke=o(".
