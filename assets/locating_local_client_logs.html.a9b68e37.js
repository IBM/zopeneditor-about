For example, when trying to understand why a specific include file was not found by the editor, the log file produced under the <code>DEBUG</code> log level will give you a trace of the editor&#39;s activities for finding ZAPP files in your workspaces, the property groups it used, as well as in which locations it is looking. You can search in the log to see where an initial request for a specific file was made, the steps of processing the request, as well as any errors that were reported. Because the requests for all the include files in a program happen in parallel, each request will have a unique request ID that will help in distinguishing the concurrent events in the log.</p><h2 id="finding-versions-of-all-vs-code-extensions-installed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#finding-versions-of-all-vs-code-extensions-installed" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Finding versions of all VS Code extensions installed</h2><p>Enabling logging also provides information that technical support will be asking for.
