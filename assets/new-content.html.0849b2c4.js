When you open a program that has copybooks or include files, and if those files are fetched from MVS through a ZAPP property group, we use the same mechanism as Zowe Explorer to store them as the exact virtual resource. It does not matter if the file is opened directly through Zowe Explorer&#39;s Date Set View, or Z Open Editor&#39;s copybooks resolution and a ctrl or cmd-click on the underlined file reference, or through our advanced z/OS Resource table: you see the same virtual file resource name in the VS Code editor tab. Unify the file resources, this enables the ability to edit the copybooks and save changes back to MVS. By default such files open as ready-only to avoid confusion introducing this feature and accidental code changes, but with the new user setting <code>&quot;zopeneditor.zowe&quot;: { &quot;readonlyRemoteIncludeFiles&quot;: &quot;&lt;true-or-false&gt;&quot;}</code> you can enable that the files are editable and can be written back to MVS. While we work on these new features, we also revisit the <code>&quot;zopeneditor.zowe&quot;: { &quot;listBeforeDownload&quot;: &quot;&lt;true-or-false&gt;&quot;}</code> setting and refine the checks we perform for the existence of a data set member before trying to download it, because 404 errors are not handled well by z/OSMF.</p><p>This release also adds a key feature to our advanced PL/I preprocessor to support developers using PL/I Macros in their code. We provide a new REXX program sample that our preprocessor feature can execute on z/OS to use the PL/I compiler to expand the macros and send the results back to our PL/I language server. PL/I developer can use this feature to eliminate the syntax errors they saw in the past when editing code with macros, as our parser does not yet have support for these statements. The preprocessor uses the expanded source code to show how macros were expanded in rich hovers inside the program editor as well as a side-by-side view. Continue to edit your program without syntax errors and regenerate the expanded macro representation and refresh the hovers on save. We added an article about our preprocessor support to our Team Blog section under <a href="./announcing-preprocessor">COBOL and PL/I preprocessor support by IBM Z\xAE Open Editor</a>.</p><p>For the IBM RSE API Plugin for Zowe CLI, we added several exciting new commands and options. One focus area is new cross-LPAR commands and new parameters for paging results, such as for long list of data set members.</p><p>This release also marks the start of a new generation of Cloud-based editing support for our platform. We retired our OpenShift Dev Spaces clone Wazi for Dev Spaces in favor of supporting Red Hat&#39;s OpenShift Dev Spaces directly. This allows users to immediately be on the latest version of OpenShift and Dev Spaces and use the same platform as their distributed development counterparts, facilitates the break down of solos and the creation of hybrid application development teams that maintain container-based and mainframe-based solution together.
