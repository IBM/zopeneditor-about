Please upgrade your local Java installation if you are still on Java 17, and set either the <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable or the <code>zopeneditor.JAVA_HOME</code> user setting accordingly.</li><li>VS Code version 1.102.3 is the minimal version into which Z Open Editor 6.0.0 can be installed, as we are utilizing the latest APIs added to VS Code. As always, we encourage users to be on the latest VS Code release, especially if you plan to try the new Model Context Protocol capability added to Z Open Editor. If you are using a cloud-based deployment of VS Code, also verify that it is upgraded to this version. At the time of this release, no version of Red Hat\xAE OpenShift\xAE Dev Spaces includes the required VS Code version. You can continue using Dev Spaces with Z Open Editor 5.7.1.</li><li>As this is a major version upgrade of Z Open Editor we recommend that you request new license activation kits from your IBM sales representative. The current 5.x keys will continue working with this version of the editor, but we recommend upgrading to be ready for future updates. If you are using an RSE API server to automatically unlock the editor, no new keys are required.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Developer for z/OS\xAE on VS Code:</p><ul><li>Z Open Editor Agent Mode: our editor now provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives your AI agent access to many of the editor&#39;s capabilities, integrating seamlessly with VS Code&#39;s Chat window. You can ask your chat agent about data sets, UNIX files, or currently running jobs, using your Zowe connection security for access. Combine the results with the power of AI to accomplish many advanced tasks. This first release includes 27 MCP tools around Zowe and Z Open Editor configuration files. See our documentation for how to enable and configure the server for your workspaces, and for examples of how to use it.</li><li>COBOL control flow graph browser: Visualize the control flow of your COBOL programs at the paragraph and section level in an interactive graph browser. Use the new browser view to examine the flow in detail with &quot;Show flow from here&quot; and &quot;Show flow to here&quot; actions, and navigate your source code simply by clicking on graph nodes.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',8),se=o("CICS TS 6.3 support: Updated the language parsers to provide syntax checking, highlighting, and content assistance for new statements and keywords for COBOL and PL/I.

If you are not using <code>files.associations</code> or the <code>zopeneditor.datasets.&lt;language&gt;Datasets</code> settings to configure the language of your data set members, and use RSE API profiles, then Z Open Editor tries to detect the language of the file for you. This can be useful for data sets that contain files in many different languages or for data sets that you have not yet used or configured. The detector utilizes the RSE API metadata scanner to guess the language, so you must use an RSE API profile to enable the feature. As the heuristic can be wrong, we added DEBUG-level logging to see its response. Just use the status bar to switch to the correct language when this happens. The feature is enabled by default for licensed users and can be disabled by setting <code>zopeneditor.zowe.disableRseApiLanguageDetection: true</code>.</li><li>The z/OS Resources table now also uses the <code>zowe.ds.paginate.dataSetsPerPage</code> user setting to define its default page size.</li><li>The Data Elements table now uses a redesigned settings menu that addresses accessibility concerns.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',4),Oe=e("li",null,[o("Fixed invalid syntax errors for COBOL multi-line "),e("code",null,"REPLACING"),o(" statements and non-blank characters in columns 73-80 when a single operand spanned multiple lines.")],-1),ke=e("li",null,[o("Fixed invalid syntax errors for COBOL "),e("code",null,"REPLACING"),o(" statements when replacing contents inside a function call.")],-1),Be=e("li",null,"Fixed the COBOL language server's Symbol Reference algorithm for redefined ambiguous references to ensure the correct symbol reference is returned.",-1),ze=e("li",null,"The Z Open Editor COBOL language server now integrates with the IBM CICS for Zowe Explorer VS Code extension.

The old names still function, so migration is not required. We also introduced two new predefined variables <code>${javaHome}</code>, which provides the absolute path to the Java home directory used by Z Open Editor, and <code>${workspace}</code>, which provides the absolute path of the workspace in which the ZAPP file resides. Both variables are helpful for defining preprocessor profiles.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',6),eo=o("Updated language parsers to support syntax checking, highlighting, and content assistance for new statements and keywords in supported programming languages.
