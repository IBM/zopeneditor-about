See the documentation and our samples repository for the list of available rules.</li><li>Added the ability to click edges in the Data Flow Browser. Clicking a solid edge opens the COBOL source at the statement that modifies the data, and clicking a dashed edge opens the source at the group&#39;s declaration.</li><li>Improved edge interaction in the Data Flow Browser and Program Control Flow Browser by making all edges easier to click and eliminating tooltip flickering when hovering over hierarchical relationships.</li><li>Enhanced the Program Control Flow Browser by adding support for COBOL source files with multiple top-level programs. Place the cursor within any program and run the <strong>Show In Program Control Flow</strong> command (using the command palette or the <strong>Show In</strong> menu by right-clicking) to display its control flow.</li><li>Added support for COBOL source files with multiple top-level programs in the Call Hierarchy feature. When you invoke <strong>Show Call Hierarchy</strong> in a COBOL file containing multiple programs, the hierarchy now correctly displays the call structure for the program at the current cursor position.</li><li>Added a new preference to adjust the HLASM remote macro scan timeout when scanning large data sets. The new preference is <code>zopeneditor.hlasm.remoteMaclibScanTimeout</code> and defaults to 3 minutes.</li><li>Updated the Advanced Feature User Build Problems View to address customer requests for the ability to disable and manually configure the feature. You must now specify the parameter <code>--errPrefix ${errPrefix}</code> in the ZAPP file to enable the feature. By default, the feature is disabled. The <code>${errPrefix}</code> variable in the ZAPP file is automatically populated with a random data set name, but you can provide your own value if you want a predefined name to be used. See the documentation for Z Open Editor and Dependency Based Build, as well as the ZAPP file in our samples repository, for details.</li><li>Fixed an issue where temporary data sets created during user build were not being deleted when using a z/OSMF Zowe profile.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented MCP tools from accessing user build log files.</li><li>Fixed the numbering of &quot;Steps&quot; in the user build output log when not performing a full upload.</li><li>Fixed issues related to reporting incorrect syntax errors when editing files with preprocessor statements using a local preprocessor executable. After running the preprocessor, incorrect syntax errors are now less likely to be reported, depending on the area of code and the content of the expanded macros. Lines with preprocessed macros are displayed in a different color, as syntax highlighting for these lines is currently not possible as they are specific to the macro language you are using. It is strongly recommended that you rerun the preprocessor whenever you make changes to these lines. In some cases, code completion might not work when editing new lines of code near macros. This is a first set of incremental improvements planned for this capability. Please submit Technical Support tickets for specific preprocessing cases that require improvement.</li><li>Updated highlighting for lines containing preprocessor statements in COBOL.</li><li>Minor updates to MCP tool meta-data, such as renaming tools, adding output schemas, and refining descriptions, to improve how chat agents can match the tools to your requests and handle the results.</li></ul><p>IBM Z\xAE Open Editor:</p>',5),_=e("li",null,"Added Quick Fix code actions support for COBOL for the following scenarios: correcting misspelled keywords, variable names, and function names; adding a qualifier to an ambiguous variable name; and adding a paragraph or section to a PERFORM statement.",-1),f=e("li",null,"Added Quick Fix code actions support for PL/I for the following scenarios: correcting misspelled keywords or variable names, and adding a qualifier to an ambiguous variable name.",-1),g=e("li",null,"Added Quick Fix code actions support for JCL for the following scenario: correcting misspelled keywords.",-1),m=e("li",null,"Added support for semantic token highlighting in JCL.",-1),w=o("Added support for code pages containing double-byte character sets in JCL programs, including visualization of shift-out (SO) and shift-in (SI) control characters, as well as codepage-aware truncation.

Please upgrade your local Java installation if you are still on Java 17, and set either the <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable or the <code>zopeneditor.JAVA_HOME</code> user setting accordingly.</li><li>VS Code version 1.102.3 is the minimal version into which Z Open Editor 6.0.0 can be installed, as we are utilizing the latest APIs added to VS Code. As always, we encourage users to be on the latest VS Code release, especially if you plan to try the new Model Context Protocol capability added to Z Open Editor. If you are using a cloud-based deployment of VS Code, also verify that it is upgraded to this version. At the time of this release, no version of Red Hat\xAE OpenShift\xAE Dev Spaces includes the required VS Code version. You can continue using Dev Spaces with Z Open Editor 5.7.1.</li><li>As this is a major version upgrade of Z Open Editor we recommend that you request new license activation kits from your IBM sales representative. The current 5.x keys will continue working with this version of the editor, but we recommend upgrading to be ready for future updates. If you are using an RSE API server to automatically unlock the editor, no new keys are required.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Developer for z/OS\xAE on VS Code:</p><ul><li>Z Open Editor Agent Mode: our editor now provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives your AI agent access to many of the editor&#39;s capabilities, integrating seamlessly with VS Code&#39;s Chat window. You can ask your chat agent about data sets, UNIX files, or currently running jobs, using your Zowe connection security for access. Combine the results with the power of AI to accomplish many advanced tasks. This first release includes 27 MCP tools around Zowe and Z Open Editor configuration files. See our documentation for how to enable and configure the server for your workspaces, and for examples of how to use it.</li><li>COBOL control flow graph browser: Visualize the control flow of your COBOL programs at the paragraph and section level in an interactive graph browser. Use the new browser view to examine the flow in detail with &quot;Show flow from here&quot; and &quot;Show flow to here&quot; actions, and navigate your source code simply by clicking on graph nodes.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',8),Re=o("CICS TS 6.3 support: Updated the language parsers to provide syntax checking, highlighting, and content assistance for new statements and keywords for COBOL and PL/I.
