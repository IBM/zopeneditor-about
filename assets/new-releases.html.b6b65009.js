If you are not using <code>files.associations</code> or the <code>zopeneditor.datasets.&lt;language&gt;Datasets</code> settings to configure the language of your data set members, and use RSE API profiles, then Z Open Editor tries to detect the language of the file for you. This can be useful for data sets that contain files in many different languages or for data sets that you have not yet used or configured. The detector utilizes the RSE API metadata scanner to guess the language, so you must use an RSE API profile to enable the feature. As the heuristic can be wrong, we added DEBUG-level logging to see its response. Just use the status bar to switch to the correct language when this happens. The feature is enabled by default for licensed users and can be disabled by setting <code>zopeneditor.zowe.disableRseApiLanguageDetection: true</code>.</li><li>The z/OS Resources table now also uses the <code>zowe.ds.paginate.dataSetsPerPage</code> user setting to define its default page size.</li><li>The Data Elements table now uses a redesigned settings menu that addresses accessibility concerns.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',4),A=e("li",null,[o("Fixed invalid syntax errors for COBOL multi-line "),e("code",null,"REPLACING"),o(" statements and non-blank characters in columns 73-80 when a single operand spanned multiple lines.")],-1),C=e("li",null,[o("Fixed invalid syntax errors for COBOL "),e("code",null,"REPLACING"),o(" statements when replacing contents inside a function call.")],-1),O=e("li",null,"Fixed the COBOL language server's Symbol Reference algorithm for redefined ambiguous references to ensure the correct symbol reference is returned.",-1),k=e("li",null,"The Z Open Editor COBOL language server now integrates with the IBM CICS for Zowe Explorer VS Code extension.
