Experience it in Z Open Editor using the trial license, which highlights code issues in the Problems view and inline with the code. Find more details in the documentation.</li><li>New advanced feature: Data Elements View which presents a sortable, searchable UI that displays information about the data elements in COBOL or PL/I programs and their included copybooks or include files. Open it through the new &quot;Show in&quot; right-click menu in the editor and on local or remote file icons. Find more details in the documentation.</li><li>Added a new RCE action to launch RCE in a VS Code webview. The existing action to launch RCE in an external browser is still available to users. Two new settings were added to disable the RCE webview and external browser launch actions, since the webview only work with servers that have valid certificates.</li><li>The Remote Console Emulator (RCE) can now be launched with an RSE API profile using token authentication. RSE API v1.2.2 or newer must be installed to use this functionality. If the installed RSE API version is older, Z Open Editor prompts the user to enter a username and password to launch RCE.</li><li>Added support for using Zowe Explorer&#39;s environment variables-based authentication for RCE&#39;s webview and external browser display.</li><li>Fixed the issue in user build where additional dependencies of type .yaml or .json were not uploaded to z/OS as UTF-8 files by default.</li><li>Fixed the issue in user build where temporary sequential data sets created during a build were not cleaned up when the build was interrupted or canceled.</li><li>Fixed the issue in the preprocessor where the context menu to compare the current file with the preprocessor output available in a z/OS data set did not appear.</li><li>Unified predefined ZAPP variables between IDz on VS Code and Eclipse so teams can use ZAPP files in either editor. Instead of using variable names such as <code>${zopeneditor.userbuild.userSettings.dbbHlq}</code>, you can now use <code>${dbbHlq}</code>, which works in both editors. The old names still function, so migration is not required. We also introduced two new predefined variables <code>${javaHome}</code>, which provides the absolute path to the Java home directory used by Z Open Editor, and <code>${workspace}</code>, which provides the absolute path of the workspace in which the ZAPP file resides. Both variables are helpful for defining preprocessor profiles.</li></ul><p>IBM\xAE Z Open Editor:</p>',5),_=o("Updated language parsers to support syntax checking, highlighting, and content assistance for new statements and keywords in supported programming languages.
