Preferences can be defined in various places depending on their scope - from user-specific settings to team project settings for files being edited. Z Open Editor distinguishes between settings provided via VS Code Preferences with settings provided in ZAPP files that are scoped to the application level and stored with your source code files. Application-specific settings, such as build flags, are typically shared with your team in ZAPP files. Personal settings, such as which Zowe profile to use for the user build, are usually in VS Code user settings.</p><h2 id="accessing-vs-code-settings-for-ibm-z\xAE-open-editor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-vs-code-settings-for-ibm-z\xAE-open-editor" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Accessing VS Code settings for IBM Z\xAE Open Editor</h2><p>To open the settings for IBM Z Open Editor in VS Code, follow the steps below:</p><ol><li><p>In VS Code, open Settings.</p><ul><li>On Windows, click <strong>File &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings</strong>.</li><li>On Mac, click <strong>Code &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p>To display the setting options for IBM Z Open Editor, expand the Extensions dropdown in the list on the left.
