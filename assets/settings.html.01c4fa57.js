These mappings will be used for Zowe Explorer MVS file content read/write operations for RSE API profiles. Note, that property groups for remote include file resolution and user build will not use this setting, but look for a workspace-local ZAPP file or if not found, a mappings file in the user&#39;s <code>.zowe/profiles/rse</code> directory.</p><p>Use the boolean setting <code>&quot;zopeneditor.zowe&quot;: {&quot;listBeforeDownload&quot;: &quot;&lt;true-or-false&gt;&quot;}</code> to modify Z Open Editor&#39;s behavior when requesting a file from MVS: - When the setting is set to <code>true</code>, the editor will first try to confirm that whether the requested file actually exists by performing a list operation for that file. If the requested file exists, the editor will send another request to download it. If the requested file does not exist, the editor will move on to test the next location listed in the property group. - When the setting is set to <code>false</code>, the editor will directly try to download the file from MVS without checking whether it actually exists. If the response from z/OS is a Not Found error, the editor will move on to the next location listed in the property group. In some cases when using z/OSMF as the protocol, this Not Found error will cause entries in z/OS log files, which you can avoid by specifying the value of the setting to <code>true</code>. However, this extra round-trip to the server to check the existence will have performance impact. Because the logging is not an issue when using the RSE API protocol and because of the performance advantage, the default value for this setting is <code>false</code>.</p><p>Use the integer setting <code>&quot;zopeneditor.zowe&quot;: {&quot;maximumParallelFileDownloads&quot;: &quot;&lt;1-to-10&gt;&quot;}</code> to specify how many parallel downloads Z Open Editor should perform when requesting include files from MVS. Downloading several files in parallel can significantly improve performance, especially when you edit programs with many include files. The downside is that some protocols such as z/OSMF will allocate more address spaces for the parallel requests, which causes more resources being used and more logging on the z/OS side. The RSE API protocol does not have that problem because it achieves scalability in other ways that are documented in the RSE documentation. The default value for this setting is 5, and the maximum value is 10. Set it to 1 to disable parallel downloads requesting one include file at the time.</p><p><code>zowe.files.temporaryDownloadsFolder.cleanup</code></p><p>The <code>zowe.files.temporaryDownloadsFolder.cleanup</code> setting is adopted from Zowe Explorer settings to support the use of multiple VS Code windows showing the same files opened via Zowe Explorer so you can see different parts of the same program on two different screens. Note that disabling the cleanup will result in files downloaded from z/OS not being removed when the editor is closed or restarted, so when you open a file via Zowe Explorer you may be viewing an outdated local version. Use the right-click &quot;Pull from Mainframe&quot; command to ensure you are working with the latest files.</p>",6);function xt(zt,Ot){const s=l("RouterLink"),a=l("ExternalLinkIcon");return r(),d(c,null,[p,e("p",null,[_,m,f,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_preferences.html"},{default:i(()=>[g]),_:1}),b]),w,v,e("p",null,[y,S,x,z,O,L,I,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[D]),_:1}),P]),F,e("p",null,[E,C,q,M,k,A,B,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[T]),_:1}),Z]),N,e("p",null,[R,U,H,V,J,j,Y,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[W]),_:1}),X]),G,e("p",null,[Q,$,K,ee,oe,te,se,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[ie]),_:1}),ne]),le,e("p",null,[ae,re,de,ce,ue,he,pe,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[_e]),_:1}),me]),fe,e("p",null,[ge,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_fileassociations.html"},{default:i(()=>[be]),_:1}),we]),ve,e("p",null,[ye,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_unreachablecodewarnings.html"},{default:i(()=>[Se]),_:1}),xe]),ze,e("p",null,[Oe,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_disableproblems.html"},{default:i(()=>[Le]),_:1}),Ie]),De,e("p",null,[Pe,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_fileassociations.html#defining-include-file-associations"},{default:i(()=>[Fe]),_:1}),Ee]),Ce,e("p",null,[qe,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_maximum_line_length.html"},{default:i(()=>[Me]),_:1}),ke]),Ae,e("p",null,[Be,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[Te]),_:1}),Ze]),Ne,e("p",null,[Re,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_fileassociations.html"},{default:i(()=>[Ue]),_:1}),He]),Ve,Je,je,e("p",null,[Ye,We,Xe,t(s,{to:"/Docs/editor_codechanges_hlasm.html#remote-macros"},{default:i(()=>[Ge]),_:1}),Qe,$e,Ke]),eo,e("p",null,[oo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_disableproblems.html"},{default:i(()=>[to]),_:1}),so]),io,e("p",null,[no,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_fileassociations.html#defining-include-file-associations"},{default:i(()=>[lo]),_:1}),ao]),ro,co,uo,ho,po,e("p",null,[_o,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_maximum_line_length.html"},{default:i(()=>[mo]),_:1}),fo]),go,e("p",null,[bo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_tabstops.html"},{default:i(()=>[wo]),_:1}),vo]),yo,e("p",null,[So,t(s,{to:"/Docs/editor_codechanges_hlasm.html#remote-macros"},{default:i(()=>[xo]),_:1}),zo]),Oo,e("p",null,[Lo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/getting_started.html"},{default:i(()=>[Io]),_:1}),Do]),Po,e("p",null,[Fo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_maximum_line_length.html"},{default:i(()=>[Eo]),_:1}),Co]),qo,e("p",null,[Mo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/locating_local_client_logs.html"},{default:i(()=>[ko]),_:1}),Ao]),Bo,e("p",null,[To,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_disableproblems.html"},{default:i(()=>[Zo]),_:1}),No]),Ro,e("p",null,[Uo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_fileassociations.html#defining-include-file-associations"},{default:i(()=>[Ho]),_:1}),Vo]),Jo,e("p",null,[jo,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_maximum_line_length.html"},{default:i(()=>[Yo]),_:1}),Wo]),Xo,e("p",null,[Go,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_disableproblems.html"},{default:i(()=>[Qo]),_:1}),$o]),Ko,e("p",null,[et,t(s,{to:"/Docs/setting_maximum_line_length.html"},{default:i(()=>[ot]),_:1}),tt]),st,e("p",null,[it,t(s,{to:"/Docs/getting_started.html"},{default:i(()=>[nt]),_:1}),lt]),at,rt,dt,ct,ut,e("p",null,[ht,e("a",pt,[_t,t(a)]),mt]),ft,e("p",null,[gt,bt,wt,t(s,{to:"/Docs/interact_zos_zowe_explorer.html#setting-up-and-using-rse-profiles-in-ibm-z-open-editor"},{default:i(()=>[vt]),_:1}),yt]),St],64)}var Dt=u(h,[["render",xt]]);export{Dt as default};
