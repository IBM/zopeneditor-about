For faster setup, a team lead can include a team configuration file with connection details in the code repository without any secure values. Each developer would enter their own secure values once they start using profiles. A team configuration file needs to be at the top level of project so that it can be read correctly in VS Code. An important thing to note is in order for the configuration profile to work properly the <code>zowe.schema.json</code> file needs to be included in the same folder as the team configuration profile.</p><p>Take a look at the location where your team configuration file resides.</p><ul><li>If you created a global <code>zowe.config.json</code>, it was placed in <code>~/.zowe</code> folder.</li><li>If you created a user configuration file scoped to 1 repository <code>zowe.config.user.json</code>, it was placed inside that repository.</li></ul><p>In both cases, a <code>zowe.schema.json</code> file should have been automatically created and placed in the same folder. If the schema file is missing, team configuration files will not work. The schema file has definitions of the supported profile attributes. If you add an extender, such as RSE CLI plug-in, the extender will update the schema file to support new profile types. Therefore, make sure to share both the team configuration file and the <code>zowe.schema.json</code> file.</p>',5),f=e("For more information about methods for sharing team configuration files, see "),u={href:"https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-sharing-team-config-files/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=e("Zowe documentation"),m=e("."),g=t('<h2 id="troubleshooting-tips" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#troubleshooting-tips" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Troubleshooting tips</h2><p>You might run into situation wherethe <code>zowe.schema.json</code> file is not automatically updated by the extender, and extender profiles are not working.
