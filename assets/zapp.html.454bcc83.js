The YAML editor extension will tell you with syntax errors when you insert incorrectly.</p><h2 id="editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-property-group-code-snippets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-property-group-code-snippets" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Editing the zapp.yaml file with property group code snippets</h2><p>ZAPP also provides code snippets so that you can enter new property groups rapidly. The code snippets are only available in the code editor when you edit a ZAPP YAML file. You will not find them in the VS Code Snippets gallery, because VS Code currently cannot distinguish between different YAML file types in their snippet gallery.</p><p>To use these code snippets:</p><ol><li>Place your cursor at the empty line at the end of the property groups in the file (around Line 85).</li><li>Press Ctrl+Space and you will see four code snippets listed in the drop-down.</li><li>Navigate down and select <code>ZAPP Remote MVS Property Groups</code> by pressing the Enter key.</li><li>You can see that a new property group is inserted with highlighted placeholders.</li><li>Before clicking or typing anything else, while the placeholders are still highlighted, use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to navigate between the placeholders and enter values for name, language (using another drop down), and syslib entries.</li><li>At the end of the new property group, add another <code>locations</code> entry by adding a new line and entering a new value such as <code>- USER1.SAMPLE.INCLUDES</code>.</li></ol><p>Remember that you need to provide a valid YAML file. As the <code>locations</code> entry requires a string array in JSON, it now needs to be entered in YAML as an ordered list using <code>-</code> for each value.</p><p>There is also a code snippet template for a complete ZAPP file. You can try it out as follows:</p><ol><li>In the current editor window for <code>zapp.yaml</code>, do a Select-All and delete all the contents of the file. You can withdraw the deletion later as the file is managed in Git.</li><li>In the first line and column of the empty document, press Ctrl+Space and select the <code>ZAPP Template</code> snippet. Instead of scrolling all the way to the bottom, you can type that snippet name instead.</li><li>You see that a snippet was inserted that contains general properties at the top as well as one property group with a local libraries entry. You can then modify as needed or add more property group entries using the respective snippets.</li></ol><h2 id="editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-user-build-code-snippets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-user-build-code-snippets" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Editing the zapp.yaml file with User Build code snippets</h2>',16),X=n("You can specify all the workspace settings for a user build in ZAPP files as documented in "),Q={href:"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/z-modernization-stack/2022.3?topic=code-setting-up-user-build",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ee=n("Setting up the user build"),ne=n(".
