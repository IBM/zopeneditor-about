As you have seen in <a href="setting_propertygroup">Setting property groups</a>, configuration settings such as property groups had to be entered as either VS Code user or workspace settings, despite being focused on describing the structure of your enterprise application. In essence, these configuration settings are actually independent of the VS Code editor. This makes it possible for property groups to be reused outside of VS Code and used with other editors or IDEs, as well as even for command-line operations for building your programs and other similar use cases.</p><p>Therefore, we created the new notion of a ZAPP file that describes your application in an independent representation, such as a YAML or JSON file, that can be managed with your source code, and that can be read by various editors and command-line tools in the future. The vision is for ZAPP files to become as useful for z/OS Enterprise Applications as Maven POM (Project Object Models) are for Java or <code>package.json</code> files are for Node.js.</p><p>Although this early version of ZAPP supports only a few Z Open Editor use cases, we are hoping that with feedback from the user community, we can evolve them over time by adding more specification items, supporting more tools, adding a command-line interface, and so on. Then, at some point we would like to provide extensibility APIs and open specifications that others can use to contribute to ZAPP as well.</p><h2 id="zapp-use-cases" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zapp-use-cases" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ZAPP use cases</h2><p>This early version of ZAPP is intended to provide a first impression to some of the ideas and to gather feedback.
