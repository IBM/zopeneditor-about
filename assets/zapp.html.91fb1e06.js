You can try it out as follows:</p><ol><li>Place your cursor behind the line with <code>language: cobol</code> (around Line 18) and press Enter to start a new line.</li><li>Press Ctrl+Space to open up the code completion drop-down.</li></ol><p>It then shows one property that was not yet used in this property group, <code>compilerOptions</code>, that could still be added here. You can add it by simply clicking the item or you the keyboard&#39;s arrow and return keys.</p><p>The same will also work with property values if they are enumeration types or boolean.</p><ol><li>Move the cursor at the end of the line <code>type: local</code> (around Line 21).</li><li>Delete the word <code>local</code> and do another Ctrl+Space.</li></ol><p>It now shows you the two allowed options <code>local</code> and <code>mvs</code> in the drop-down that you can choose from.</p><p>You also see in the drop-down various code snippets that could be inserted here. However, you see that properties are listed context-sensitive, i.e. the drop-down only shows entries that are allowed to be inserted here. Code snippets are not context sensitive and will always be displayed. You need to make sure you use them syntactically correct. The YAML editor extension will tell you with syntax errors when you insert incorrectly.</p><h2 id="editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-property-group-code-snippets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-property-group-code-snippets" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Editing the zapp.yaml file with property group code snippets</h2><p>ZAPP also provides code snippets so that you can enter new property groups rapidly. The code snippets are only available in the code editor when you edit a <code>zapp.yaml</code> file. You will not find them in the VS Code Snippets gallery, because VS Code currently cannot distinguish between different YAML file types in their snippet gallery.</p><p>To use these code snippets:</p><ol><li>Place your cursor at the empty line at the end of the property groups in the file (around Line 85).</li><li>Press Ctrl+Space and you will see four code snippets listed in the drop-down.</li><li>Navigate down and select <code>ZAPP Remote MVS Property Groups</code> by pressing the Enter key.</li><li>You can see that a new property group is inserted with highlighted placeholders.</li><li>Before clicking or typing anything else, while the placeholders are still highlighted, use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to navigate between the placeholders and enter values for name, language (using another drop down), and syslib entries.</li><li>At the end of the new property group, add another <code>locations</code> entry by adding a new line and entering a new value such as <code>- USER1.SAMPLE.INCLUDES</code>.</li></ol><p>Remember that you need to provide a valid YAML file. As the <code>locations</code> entry requires a string array in JSON, it now needs to be entered in YAML as an ordered list using <code>-</code> for each value.</p><p>There is also a code snippet template for a complete ZAPP file. You can try it out as follows:</p><ol><li>In the current editor window for <code>zapp.yaml</code>, do a Select-All and delete all the contents of the file. You can withdraw the deletion later as the file is managed in Git.</li><li>In the first line and column of the empty document, press Ctrl+Space and select the <code>ZAPP Template</code> snippet. Instead of scrolling all the way to the bottom, you can type that snippet name instead.</li><li>You see that a snippet was inserted that contains general properties at the top as well as one property group with a local libraries entry. You can then modify as needed or add more property group entries using the respective snippets.</li></ol><h2 id="editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-user-build-code-snippets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-zapp-yaml-file-with-user-build-code-snippets" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Editing the zapp.yaml file with User Build code snippets</h2>',16),$e=e("You can specify all the workspace settings for a user build in ZAPP files as documented in "),Xe={href:"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/developer-for-zos/16.0?topic=code-setting-up-user-build",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Ke=e("Setting up the user build"),Qe=e(".
