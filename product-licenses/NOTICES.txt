      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under
this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if
it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program
that are not Modified Works.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the
Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary
License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that
is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original
work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from
an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including,
for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents
of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case
in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner
that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including
but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or
any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions
as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense
the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of
such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes
such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall
not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware
per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that
the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional
grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result
of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
(if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section
3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source
Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how
to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this
Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code
under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under
a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined
with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary
License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice
described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution
notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability ('notices') contained
within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided
that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect
to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program
in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing
of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate
with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering,
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product
X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties,
and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated
with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or
loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR
THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations
of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.
If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease
use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order
to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in
the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility
to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program
not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses
when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License,
v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional
permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient
to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory)
where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Python 2.0 License Information

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative
font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and
to provide an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as
long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
bundled, embedded, redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names of
derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:

- font files
- data files
- source code
- build scripts
- documentation
"Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by users and any other names as
specified after the copyright statement.

"Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the
Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by adding to, deleting, or
substituting  in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing
formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who
contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software,
to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies
of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Standard or Modified Versions,
may be sold by itself.
2) Standard or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and sold with
any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These
can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily
viewed by the user.
3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s), in part or in whole,
unless explicit written permission is granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to
all references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and other font description
fields, which are used to differentiate the font from others.
4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to
promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of
the Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed using this
license, and may not be distributed under any other license.
TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
FONT SOFTWARE.
